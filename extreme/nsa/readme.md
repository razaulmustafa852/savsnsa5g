- During extreme mobility experiments, we only encountered NSA mode. Consequently, all the experiments involving NR - Channel Logs are stored in the (`📁` NR) folder, while its corresponding QoE logs are in the (`📁` QoE) folder, and its QoE Events are in the (`📁` QoE_Events) folder.
- Consider an example to simplify: NR - Channel logs for experiment (`📄` NR_Exp_mc3.csv) has its QoE Logs in (`📁` QoE) folder with name (`📄` QoE_Exp_mc3.csv) and QoE Events in (`📁` QoE_Events) folder as (`📄` QoE_Events_Exp_mc3.csv)
